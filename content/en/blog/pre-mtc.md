Hello everyone! I just wanted to write something before I head off onto the plane and the MTC. I'm certainly going to miss everyone and once again, thank you all for helping me get to this point in my life.

I keep getting asked how I feel about this and honestly, I'm just excited. I've been excited ever since I opened my call back in July but I know that I was supposed to enter this mission field at this time in my life, both for my own good and for the good of those that I am going to go serve. I've learned many lessons to this point and most have been good. Some have been bad, but I've learned from those and they've helped me get here.

For those that asked, being set apart as a missionary is, honestly, not all that different right away. I mean, yeah, you are set apart by the proper authority and I know that things have certainly changed, especially now in ways that I cannot see yet. But really, it's not completely different...right now. I know I'll definitely start seeing the changes and the impact this has as I begin my mission.

> Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.

> D&C 4:2
