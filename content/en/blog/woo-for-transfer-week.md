It was transfers this week! I mean I didn't go anywhere, so it was a normal week for me, but my district was shuffled a bit. The Clapham Elders that we lived with moved to our district so it makes it a lot easier! Elder Chavez and Elder Lorange are really awesome, and it's fun to share a flat with them!

Anywayssss hope y'all are doing well! It was an interesting week for me. It rained quite a bit, woke up to some nice fog one day, it was kinda cold too. I can't remember much about what happened this week, besides Friday and Sunday.

Sunday we got to help with a primary activity, it was super fun. One of the YSAs lead singing time, and she asked us to help! So she gave up some cheap ties, I got a hot pink piano one, it was great. Whenever the primary kids sang well, they cut to cut a piece of one of our ties off, I found out I remember primary songs, and I love some of them! Primary songs are really simple, but I love them, I played a few songs on the piano, and they're just great. I love music so much, sadly I can't have a saxophone on the mission, but piano is good too I guess !ðŸ˜‚.

Friday, we got to go to the temple! We took a train to Lingfield, then the church arranged a taxi to get to the temple. We went with a new member, it was his first time doing baptisms for the dead! He really liked it, and it was definitely a special experience. I felt the Spirit really strongly, especially since it was just us, our friend, and one other companionship. The paintings in the London temple are so pretty! The outside looks literally like a giant box, like giant... the London temple is actually huge, way bigger than any temple I've seen besides the Salt Lake one. After we were finished, we went and walked the grounds while we were waiting for our taxi. The grounds were so pretty! It was just a giant lawn, with big trees, a pond and a river, it was all really green, and it was lightly raining, more like a mist, so everything was super pretty.

It definitely grew my testimony of how important temples are, and I was so happy we got to go, right after President Nelson talked about needing temples in our lives! It was perfect, and I know it wasn't a coincidence! I know that temples are truly there to help us and those who are on the other side of the veil. That's how easy it is to be a missionary and baptize people! Just go to the temple! It's not that difficult, makes you have an awesome week, you feel the Spirit, and you help others! It's a win-win-win-win! I promise just like President Nelson said, as you make an effort and go to the temple, it will help you be protected from Satan's influence and you will have an amazing week! Anyways, hope y'all have a great week, emails are appreciated, and love you all!
