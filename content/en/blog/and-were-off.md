Today was my final day of MTC! It went by wayyyy too fast, and it was such an amazing experience! My teachers, Sister Hernandez and Brother Woodbury were the best teachers ever! They definitely were led by the Spirit, and knew exactly what me and my awesome district needed. My companions were super amazing too! I learned to work with Elder Keller and Elder Niederhauser really well, and we taught lessons and planned really well too. It is awesome to have a trio, and we were definitely the best. One thing I learned this past week that really stuck out to me is the fact that really nothing can be the same after I get back. Well I mean it could, but YOU CAN'T LET IT. It shouldn't be! You continue teaching and bringing others to the Doctrine of Christ just as much! I really love that, and it's both a little hard, and really inspiring to know that what I called 'normal life' won't be ever normal again. This is my new life! While I'll have trials and hardships, and really everyone will, I know it always turns out in the end. The cool thing is, WE KNOW WHO WINS!! So why worry?? Anyways, hope y'all are safe, and the next email will be from London England!
