It's crazy how fast the MTC goes. I only have a week left! As far as I know I'm still going to London, England, so that's super exciting, and I feel like I'm getting closer to being ready. The nice thing about the lessons we teach, is that it's stuff that I have known basically since primary, and I already have a testimony about. I learned that though you can have a testimony about it, there is ALWAYS room to grow, if you leave that testimony open for growth, it won't, and you'll be stuck where you are. I promise, no matter how old you are, your testimony can still improve and grow. because that is what this life is for! To continue to grow and to learn as much as we can.

I have also learned through this amazing experience, is that while I'm definitely not a perfect teacher, and I don't always know exactly what they need, the Holy Ghost does. He knows what they are feeling, and he can tell them exactly what they need, so always leave room for the Holy Ghost in your lessons. It's okay to not know everything because the Holy Ghost knows literally everything (D&C 35:19). I know that through experience, that the Holy Ghost can do anything, and that the power of the Holy Ghost is very real. Anyone can use it if they align themselves with God's will, and he can do anything if you let him, so let the Holy Ghost pick up the slack when you need him to!

Thanks for all the support, and be safe!

Sadly, don't have any pictures, because, you know, just chilling at home, but I'll make up for it when I go to the field! ......if I remember
