So, I purposefully left out some details in my weekly, as I'm sure you figured out. I'll cut straight to the point.

For those that don't know, I'm now home. So what lead to this?

Well, over the course of my time here in the mission field, I've been meeting with a counselor to help with some emotional concerns that I had beginning this new adventure. Well, the other day, I received a call from my mission president and he wanted to know how I was doing with all that has been going on. I told him that I was doing fine but as we got to talking about all that has been happening, he expressed concern for my well being. He then asked me to call my parents and counsel with them about it. So I did, and I figured out in that call that it might be best for me to come home during this time for the emotional support that I need. I will still be seeing a counselor about these issues while I am here at home.

But that is not the only reason for my coming home. As I have said in past emails, I have issues with my ankles and my right foot is currently in a boot because of this. While I was talking with my mission president about it, we also said that even if I was able to get through this emotionally, I would still have to go home at some point to have some sort of operation done on my foot to fix whatever is wrong with it. So during these calls with my mission president and my parents, we collectively decided it would be best for me to come home now, rather than delay it for two weeks.

So that's the situation I'm in right now. I'd just like everyone to know that I love them, I loved serving my mission, and I'm ready to see what the Lord has in store for me in the future. That might be going back out on a mission, or going to college, serving a service mission, or whatever the Spirit prompts me to do. I love you all, and it's been great.

Nos vemos pronto,
