As I stand here in the wind, I have a thought to write this post.

Standing in the wind, to me, seems to be calming despite the circumstances as to why I'm standing in the wind. Standing in the wind is like this life and the trials that it contains. The wind is those trials and you have a choice on how you can be manipulated by those trials.

The wind pushes on me, causing me to lean. However, when my friend (he's a brother to me) comes to stand next to me, I'm no longer pushed on by the wind. He is pushed upon, but our support of each other causes us to be unmovable to the wind. I no longer sway in the wind and neither does he. This goes to show that you might sway in your own wind but with the help of others and trusting in God, we can be unmovable no matter what winds come to push upon us.

Let me tell you a story of an event that has happened to me recently that has since made me stand stronger in the wind. One of my best friends recently lost their dad, a man who I viewed as a second father. When my father wasn't around, he always seemed to be there. Throughout the grieving process, I've managed to find myself stuck at anger. Not at anyone else, but myself. Angry that I'm still sad about his death. Angry in the manner that I think I'm taking attention away from the family. But as I've been reading my scriptures, I've found that I shouldn't be angry about his death; in fact, you might could say that I should be rejoicing. Rejoicing in the fact that he has returned to (hopefully) return to live with his Heavenly Father. That he now can understand what his family is going through and how he can help them. In fact, I've heard two things from multiple people that has comforted me. They've said that "He was taken off this Earth because Heavenly Father is building up his priesthood in heaven for the second coming" and "In the scriptures [I don't know where], it says that from every family, someone volunteered to go before everyone else to prepare their mansions in heaven". These sayings have comforted me in this and I'm thankful for them.

To finished this off, I have a scripture to share with you that summarized what I've said. It's Mosiah 5:15.

> Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven, and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.
