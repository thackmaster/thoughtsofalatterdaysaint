Guys it's week 2! I'm still alive alive! Just kidding, that shouldn't be a surprise. Anyways, hope tall are well, I've had a pretty good week! I've only crashed once, and I think the Holy Ghost is getting used to helping me off my bike, because everytime I crash, I end up with bike behind me, and I'm standing in front of it really confused... so grateful for that!  This week has been a bit hard for teaching people, we had so many lessons cancel! We didn't have many lessons, and people are just hard to get a hold of in general. We have had some cool miracles though!

We were contacting right by our house, and two guys flagged us over and said they just moved in, and are super interested in our church! He sounded like he knew the Bible, and he was happy to get a Book of Mormon, so that's awesome! We also had a pass off lesson from the Hermanas, this lady was so nice, and she was super interested too!

This area is a bit sketchy at some points unfortunately, my companion got shot by a pellet gun while we were talking to a lady! Like, why?? It was not too cool and we left quickly after that, it just gave him a welt mostly, but still! Crazy.

Other than that, I have some pretty cool news, my date to leave for London got moved up... to this Friday!! Wooo I'm going to London this Friday! Super excited.

Sorry this was long, but I've really learned a lot, something that I learned is that everyone is very different, and everyone is at different stages of learning. Some are super ready for the Gospel, and some... not so much. But everyone is a child of God! We love them all, and give them ALL a chance to receive the Gospel! Love you all, and be safe!
