Yep, I asked what I should call my weekly email to the three other Elders in my flat, and we got the be octopus! So I'm going with it.

Anyways, hello all! Hope everything is fantastic! It was quite the crazy week! Monday we went to London again for Monday, which is still weird to say! Who gets to say, "oh I just went to central London for P-day, no big deal." Still so weird. But anways, it was fun! Wednesday, we had interviews! Literally took all day, but it was really cool just talking aboht ways we can help people continue to take lessons, and help them feel the Spirit as well! We've had a lot more lessons, which was super fun! I absurdly love teaching, and it's the best when the friend you're teaching understands it, and wants to know more! Saturday, we got to play rugby again! The guys who we play are pretty cool, and ive learned rugby is so fun actually! The only problem, I kinda wrecked knee... nothing too bad, I just dived for the ball and bashed my knee on someone's backpack they used as the border of the fieldðŸ˜‚. It was nice and swollen after that so walking is super fun! Kinda bad decision making on my part, but oh well! It was fun.

We had stake conference on Saturday and Sunday, which was super good! I learned sitting for stake conference is a lot harder than sitting in a missionary meeting for some reason, but they talked a lot about missionary work and helping the missionaries, which I can't complain about!

A returned missionary said something, that really touched me at the beginning of Stake conference. He was baring his testimony, and he said at the end, though he didn't feel like he had an incredible change, he felt like the story of the blind man which Jesus healed and was questioned by the Pharisees. The blind man basically says, "I don't know very much, but what I do know, is that I was blind, and know I can see." And he related it to himself, which I thought was so powerful! Though I have learned and changed, there are definitely times when I've doubted myself, if I haven't learned enough, or if I'm not making as much progress as I think I should, I know one thing, and that is that I was blind, and know can see spiritually, and that is purely because the Heavenly influence of Jesus Christ. I'm going to go ahead and guess, that after the blind man was healed by Jesus, he didn't just sit down and be content, I guarantee that he shared his miracle with others! He shared that he was healed, and that others can be as well! And that's exactly what I'm doing. Being like that once-blind man, and helping others to receive that miracle of sight as well!

I challenge all of you to remember the time that you were blind and that you received sight to learn, change and progress in the church. Now don't just sit there, go out and share it with others! Don't you want everyone to experience that amazing experience of receiving spiritual sight? Only you can share that it them, so get out and share it with them! I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen!

Love yall, have a good week!
