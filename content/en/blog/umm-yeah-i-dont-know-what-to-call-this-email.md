Hi guys! How yall doing? Hopefully good. Sooooo, I'm doing good, quite a busy week, it was great! First off, we got news that Elder Holland, Ballard, and Cook is visiting England!!!!! They're talking to all of us missionaries in person, and I'm so incredibly excited! It's Friday, and I can't wait!
We've had a lot of referrals, and a lot of street contacting, and I'm getting better! We've finally got back in contact with a lot of people and we're getting lessons! Yay!!

So I'll just tell some stories that happened, cause not sure what else to do!

Monday, we went to a lot of charity shops, which was cool. Got a sweet overcoat, it's wool, so super warm and comfortable, and I love it!

So Friday, we went with the Clapham Elders to a members house and ate food! Somehow it got to the subject of if eating foxes is legal, because they're all over here, and I said "Why would you eat a fox anyway! It's so small, it's like eating a cat!" Then this member lady, sister oiying just says put of nowhere "dog tastes better"..... I let out an involuntary gasp, because I love dogs, and she just talked about eating one! My companion, Elder Baudains looks at me when she said this, because he knows I love dogs, and sees my mortified face and just bursts out laughing! I started absolutely dying of laughter, and try to hide it, and when they looked at me, I just said "I'm okay, I just got something in my throat." It was quite the experience! Then we taught Seminary after, so that was fun!

Sunday, yesterday, someone that the Sisters met while doing a blitz in Crystal Palace, our area came to church! We made sure to talk to him after, and he asked us why we loved this church, and why we came on a mission. It was perfect, because I was able to think back on the reason why I really did go on a mission! I was able to bear my testimony about the power of the Gospel in our lives, and he seemed super happy about our answer! Before he didn't want a Book of Mormon, then once he listened to us, he happily took one and said he would read it! It was such a cool experience!

Last one I promise, we were finally able to teach someone a full lesson, because it's been awhile since we've gotten someone to actually take a lesson! It was so good, and I definitely felt the Spirit as we talked. She loved it and was excited for another lesson!

I love getting any emails, and love you all! Be safe!

*P.S don't have any pictures! Very sad, I'll have some next time I promise!*
