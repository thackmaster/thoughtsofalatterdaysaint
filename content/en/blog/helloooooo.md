Hey yall! Hope everyone's doing awesome, I definitely am!So this week was quite busy, contacting people, and finding, and all that, but it was good! We've gotten better at finding, we've managed to stop several people! I've found out I have a gift for stopping people with dogs... which is basically everyone, and then I get to pet then! So win-win for me! It's gotten to the point the dogs will just come up to me now, so it works pretty well. ðŸ˜‚

The weather! My goodness! It's rained so much, but it's windy too, so no umbrella helps! Also I didn't realize the amount of mud that came with the rain.... my shoes and bottom of my trousers are just destroyed with mud. It's sunny today though! Well, was sunny, it looks like it's about to rain now, so that's cool.

We've made some friends this week! Sadly, they didn't come to church with us, but there's two people, Christopher and Joanna, and we've had super good lessons with them! We had an amazing lesson with Joanna about the Restoration! We were literally just sitting outside our flat, in the wet grass, in the dark, and had the best lesson ever! She loves the fact that God restored His church, and we asked her to pray if this church was God's true church, and she said she would! So prayers for Joanna!

Sorry, this might be a long email, but something else that happened, was President Ballard, Elder Holland, and Elder Cook came and talked to us! It was cool because they all served missions here, and I think it was Elder Holland who served in my district!! It was so spiritual just to see them walk in, and then they had a youth talk on Saturday, and a Stake conference on Sunday! It was so cool, because it was just for the U.K and Ireland, so we all felt special.

Something I learned from that, I took from a couple of their talks. Elder Cook talked about having a sense of urgency on the missionary field, because, like Elder Holland said, there is NOTHING that is better that we could be doing right now that is spreading the Gospel. That is literally the most important thing you could ever do! Made me happy to be on a mission, but it really applies to everyone! Everyone can spread the Gospel even of you're not a missionary. We need to all be urgent in the need to give this amazing Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world! President Ballard said in his talk on Sunday to pray every day and ask our Heavenly Father to put someone in our path to share the Gospel too. I want to extend this challenge to all of you! Pray every day to share the Gospel with one person! He ended with "The greatest gift we could give Jesus Christ is to bring someone to His Gospel". I know that's true, and I'm definitely taking that challenge, because I want to give a little bit back to Jesus Christ because of all He's done for me! I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen!

Love you all! Stay safe!
