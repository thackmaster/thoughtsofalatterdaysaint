Yes, the place I live in is called Tooting Bec, it's a very interesting place. Anyways, how are yall doing?? I'm doing pretty awesome, the work is steadily moving forward! We taught quite a few lessons, and some people are really promising!

We get so many referrals and most of them come to nothing, but we called one referral and she answered! She said her and her husband loves Jesus and they love the Bible too, and they're talking to a neighbor that's having a hard time about Jesus too! She wants to have lessons, and with her neighbor! That's three people to teach! It's a definite miracle, and we've had one lesson with her and her husband, unfortunately her neighbor couldn't make it, but it was an amazing lesson! We talked about the Atonement in the Bible, and how the Book of Mormon is a companion to the Bible, because it just expounds on the Atonement! It was an amazing lesson, and I was able to bear my testimony about the Atonement, which I love to do!

We also went to a baptism! We had testimony meeting, which I got to bear my testimony again! Yay! Then we went to a baptism that the other Elders in our flat had, it was definitely an amazing experience, and he was an amazing guy.

Funny story, we were going to go to a blitz, which means every missionary in a district get together in one place and just street contact everywhere, it's super fun! Anyway, we were heading to Catford, which is normally just under two hours, and we had to get on three different busses. We'll the first one was fine, the next one was crazy late! It was like twenty minutes late, then the third was late too! When it came, you stick your arm out and they stop for you to get on, we did that and it zoomed by! So we had to wait another half an hour for the next bus, I literally stared at a spider for like an hour. By that point we were over three hours late, and just kind of wandered to the park with the other Elders that lived there, and then had to go home, we did talk to some people, but it took so long!

That's about how London travel is normally, so that's a glimpse of my travel basically every dayðŸ˜‚. It's good though, and I love being here, the people we teach are amazing, and I love the work, there's nothing I could be doing better than spreading the Gospel to the world!  Love yall, and feel free to email back!
