Over the last year, I've come to realize some not-so-pleasant things about others. I never thought that it would be possible to become friends with someone and then have them stab you in the back. It hurts, and I had never felt this sort of hurt before. I was left with many questions but I was focused on one in particular: what did I do wrong? What did I miss?

Over time, I struggled a lot with this. I kept looking back at everything and seeing things from a different point of view. But there was nothing wrong with what I was looking back upon. However, I told myself that there was. There was something there that I couldn't see and I was determined to find it.

It wasn't until a few months ago when I finally came to terms with what had happened. I was tired of this dragging me down and I had lost my senior year of high school to this one thing that I had no control over. And it wasn't easy. I still struggled with it every once in a while. But the other day, I had a coworker tell me something that I'll never forget. She went through something similar and told me:
It's at that time that you realize that it's not you, it's them.

It's not something that you did; it's something that the other person maybe didn't do, overlooked, passed by. Maybe they didn't realize that you were the one who was always there when they needed you the most. Maybe they took advantage of you, and when you had realized it, you left and they didn't realize until it was too late that you weren't coming back. It's finally at that time they start to realize they might have messed up.

Everyone messes up, we're all human and none of us are perfect. That's why we are here on this Earth today, to be tested and to learn. And with the help of our Heavenly Father, we may be able to overcome these hardships and learn to forgive those who have wronged us.
