You ever had someone act like they're too good for something? Maybe too good for you? Now it doesn't necessarily have to be someone that you're crushing on. Maybe an old friend. Maybe a colleague. Or maybe even yourself! We all do it at some point in our lives, even if it's unintentional. Even if somebody doesn't call you out on it, you've probably acted like you're too good for someone else. I know I have and almost anyone I've ever been around has acted like that to someone else at some point, whether intentional or not.

While unaware of it, you're actually still totally conscious of what you're doing. Your brain, however, chooses to ignore it most of the time. But the person you're directing that to notices right away. If they don't happen to notice that specifically, they do notice that something is amiss. But as you continue to direct that negative energy toward that person, they notice and begin to leave you alone as your actions suggest. Those of you who are feeling that energy, be careful! That person can turn on a dime, suddenly needed or wanting your help and assistance. But as soon as you give that to them, they turn their nose up and walk away once again.

I know this from personal experience and I'm sure you have as well. Maybe not exactly like that, but something similar. I'm not going to tell about that experience. Everyone knows what it's like to be in both sides of this evil equation. Just be careful who you trust and the way you treat others. If there's someone you don't want to be friends with anymore, figure out a nice way to tell them. It's much better (in my opinion) to be told up front rather have to sidestep around that person to figure it out. It's also more painful if you have to find out from someone else.
