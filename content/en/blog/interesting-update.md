So for those who don't know, I'm still not in London.... I literally called them the day before I was supposed to get on my flight, and no one knows where my visa and passport is! So that's fun, It's been kind of hard being called as a missionary, and not really anything to do, but I've managed and I got a reassignment! So, I'm officially going to San Bernardino California on Tuesdayyyyyy! So finally flying out somewhere and I'm excited to teach the Gospel! It is temporary, it's just until my visa decides to wander it's way to the Salt Lake travel office, so who knows when I'll be flying to London! But I'm just happy to finally be able to do something, but I have found some tender mercies. I've been able to be Elder Laytons companion quite a bit, since his family is at school and everything, and it's been cool to listen to his classes because they're in Spanish, and I can actually understand them pretty well. I usually just end up laying on the floor listening, but I mean it was doing something. Some other fun things have been tying a quilt in two days.... that's about it, but I managed! I know that God always has a plan, and I'm just really blessed to be able to serve in two places! So love y'all, and be safe!
