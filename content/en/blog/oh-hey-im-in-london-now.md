Hello everyone! It's been a crazy week, but we're all good! I honestly can't remember what happened earlier in the week, so we're going to skip to Thursday!

We have zone conference Thursday, and it was really cool! We had a bunch of zones come and we had some trainings and other things like that, definitely felt the Spirit, and I got to play the piano for the closing hymn!

Friday I got up at 4:00 AM, and headed off to London! I traveled all day and arrived at London Saturday morning. I was exhausted, but excited!

Let me tell you, it was definitely a culture shock. Everything is very compact, especially the roads, its scary to ride in a car because everyone is passing so close to each other! Apparently it's a standard thing to just drive on the curb to doge somebody, kinda scary. My 'flat' is pretty nice, though there's four of us here, so a bit crammed. It's so pretty here though! Everything is super green, and it's rained 1 of 2 days I've been here, and it might rain again today! My companion Elder Boudains, is really cool, he's from Australia! You get a lot of foreign missionaries here, I've met one from Brazil and Lithuania! It's super cool. Our ward is mostly African, and they're all really cool, though it's a tiny, tiny ward, like fifteen people. I'm excited to start teaching people and it's been really interesting so far!

I've been a kinda stressed being in a completely new place with no idea what I'm doing, but it's definitely strengthened my testimony on the power of prayer and scriptures! I was super exhausted and confused and stressed on the first day, so I just sat down, and I prayed and started reading the scriptures, even though I was about falling asleep, it still helped calm me down so much. I know that scriptures not only teach knowledge, but can help with stress or any other negative feeling. They bring the Spirit so powerfully even if you're just reading them without studying. I promise that if you are ever stressed about anything! School, work, or just life in general, find time to just sit down, pray, and then read the scriptures for a bit, doesn't matter where, just read and you will find the peace and calm we all look for in our lives. I know that the Gospel is the same no matter where you are! Be it Utah, California, or clear in London! The Gospel is the same, and it can help anyone find peace and comfort in their lives if they let it in. I love you all, and be safe!
