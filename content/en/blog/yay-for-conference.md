Conference was amazing this week! Yall better have watched it xD, if you haven't, watch it! It was super good. It was weird because where I'm seven ours ahead, we watched the first session at 5:00pm and the second session was 9 to 11 at night! A bit hard to stay awake, but we managed. I loved how most of them talked about the simple things, like how God loves us, we need to go to church, and the Atonement is really there for all of us. We hear these things a lot, but it's always good to be reminded, and to never take them for granted! It's so amazing that God loves us, and the Atonement is truly there to help us repent! I'm glad the Prophet, Apostles, and others were able to take the time to remind us all.

Besides conference, it wasn't a super crazy week, we've just been trying to get a hold of people, to set up lessons. Our zone made a new goal to be outside the flat by 10 o'clock, and don't come back besides lunch until 9 o'clock, this way we can meet more people! It took a few days to get adjusted, but I bet it will help all of us! I'm definitely staying busy, and that's always good! One thing that wasn't too fun, is that there's four of us Elders in a small flat, so when one of us gets sick... yeah we all do, so we all got a nice cold! Yay! It's interesting because one of us starts coughing, then the others start laughing because they're coughing, then we start coughing which makes us all laugh and cough harder! It's a truly vicious cycle.

Besides that, I guess this will be a short email! I know this church is true, and I get seenit in those who we teach that they can feel the Spirit when we teach them. I absolutely love seeing other people feel the Spirit and start to understand why this church is so amazing! Our prophet is truly called of God, and the things we hear from them is straight from our Heavenly Father! Isn't that crazy! When we hear the prophet speak, it's LITERALLY Heavenly Father speaking right to us! That's such an amazing privilege we have, and we can never take it for granted! I love you all, and feel free to send some emails or letters, they're always fun to get!
