Ah, here we are. Week 2 P-day came a little early this time but it's good (está bien). These last few days have been absolutely amazing and I've loved it! Also, I found out right after my last email that I can read any email that comes in during the week, but I can't respond until my P-Day. Anyhow, onto the letter!

Sunday was epic. I barely understood the talks that were given but the Spirit was there testifying about the truth of whatever they were saying. We started of the day with a presentation about the importance of chastity. The adversary was very determined to be there and made everyone feel guilty, even though we were all just fine. If we weren't, we wouldn't be able to be here. Then we watched an MTC exclusive video from Elder Holland. I'll admit, he gets right up in your face about it. He said some awesome quotes but one in particular hit all of us like a brick wall. He said the following in reference to leaving the church after serving a mission, "You can never go back, it will never be the same. If you do, you will... break the heart of God himself." Wow. That is powerful. Just taking that in, in that moment, was heartbreaking to think about.

Monday was fantastic! Our teacher's took the class and separated us into mock investigators and missionaries so we could apply what we've been taught the past week. I'll admit, it was a bit rough on my part lol. My situation I was given was a 64-year-old alcoholic whose parents were rich but passed away and his sister took all the money they had. Quite a rough go that invrstigator had. And I had a rough go at figuring out what to say but it's okay! We all make mistakes, we learn from those, and apply it a different way. Then I got to be an investigator. My situation there was being a 23-year-old single dad with a one-year-old boy. It was cool to be able to see both sides of those. Then our teacher was an investigator herself and, with our companion, we had to introduce ourselves, get to know her and the situation she was in, and make an appointment for a later day and time. I'll admit, my Spanish there was rough but Hermana Arizmendi (our teacher) said I was doing well for having known Spanish for only a week. She then bore her testimony en Español. I understood a little of what she said but what I didn't hear or understand, the Spirit made up for. It brought tears and it was amazing! It makes me so excited for the field!

Tuesday was just as amazing! We had new missionaries arrive and our casa (which was just only four of us) grew in size to the full twenty personas. There was a missionary who lost his district so we took him to recepción and got it all squared away. We arrived to our afternoon class and discovered that there were volunteers that we were just supposed to talk to and get to know them. Elder Ramirez and I started with a couple. We were only supposed to be there for like seven minutes but we were talking to them for like twenty. It was so awesome! While I can barely speak Spanish, I understood about 65% of what was said. The Spirit made up for what I couldn't understand. The Gift of Tongues certainly is real and I've been able to see it work in my life.

Another Elder shared a scripture this week that I really enjoyed.

> 24 And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.
>
> 27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.
>
> Ether 12:24 & 27

Have an absolutely amazing week and remember that God loves you. I know that God is real and wants to talk with you. He loves you and so long as you try your hardest, he will be proud of those efforts. I love you all! Talk to you next week!
