How are yall?? It's been pretty awesome FINALLY being out in the field! I was assigned two epic trainers, Elder Westfall and Elder Hunsaker! They have taught me so much and it's fun to teach and to just talk to everyone!

So cool news, I'm a bike mission! Its actually so nice, because you can talk to people on the way to lessons and stuff! Though it takes FOREVER to get anywhere, and boy, when you get a flat tire, which has happened twice this week... you're kinda stuck, but I've loved it, and we've had many miracles on them. Great exercise too!ðŸ˜‚

One big lesson that was basically hammered into my skull, not literally, calm down, was talk to EVERYONE, literally the first day I got here, Elder Westfall complimented on this guy's watch, and we ended up talking to him for like an hour! He openly said he was a gang member which was cool, you meet a lot of them here, but they're pretty cool! A lot of them love God and just want to change.

I love the people here so much and I know I came here for a reason, remember, anyone can bring someone to God, if just telling them to have an awesome day can help them so much! Love y'all and have a good week!

Love, Elder Rasmussen

P.S, So sorry! My email didn't send on Monday for some reason? Don't know why
