Hallo, hope all is going well,

What a week! Was it even a week? Not even sure anymore. Yall it goes so fast! It's truly incredible how speedy a mission goes! I'm always so tired when I go to bed and wake up, but I guess that's good! Means I've done somethingðŸ˜‚.

Basically it's been A LOT of finding and setting up lessons. When I started in Crystal Palace, yes that is my area, not to brag, but it's the coolest ever, anyways there was not a lot of people we were in contact with, now there's so many! They are a bit difficult to get roped into lessons, but it has taught me a lot about patience!

I've learned a lot about patience during my mission! Not just trying to get a hold of people, but just EVERYTHING takes so long! Answers come when God needs you to know, so it's OK to have questions that aren't being answered immediately, that's why in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, faith comes first, because without faith, we got nothing! Faith always comes first, so when you have questions, keep your faith! I promise it will be so much easier, don't let any questions take over your faith, just push forward, and have patience! God truly does know when you need it the most, and to be honest, it's hardly ever going to be immediately. I'm a very inpatient person, but I know if I take time to look at it through an eternal perspective, and know that God has a plan, it can help me improve my patience! Cause we all need that good ol patience!

Anyways, love ya all! Send in some emails, so I know you're still aliveðŸ˜‚ cheers!
