Hello everybody! Yes, I am still alive, and it has been the best week ever! I was worried about being on a computer for seven, sometimes eight hours, but it hasn't been bad, because there's always something to do.

My District is absolutely awesome! I was worried how well I would be able to connect with everyone without ever seeing them in person, but I really have and they have all shared some amazing comments that I have really learned from. We have about six hours of class everyday, and that entire time we are all just focused, and I love how unified and oriented to the missionary goal we are! It's really helped me, and I really look up to them all.

I was blessed with two companionships actually, so that was interesting. My first companion Elder Rich was so awesome, and we worked super well together! Sadly he was sent to MTC in person, but I know he was my companion for that couple of days for a reason. My companions now are Elder Niederhauser and Elder Keller. They are definitely some awesome people, and they always have so many cool thoughts on different principles and scriptures, so I'm blessed to be with them.

One thing I have learned is that Satan will work really hard on you, because of course he doesn't want me to spread the Gospel, that hurts his kingdom, so he tries to make you feel inadequate or like you don't know enough to teach. One thing I've learned this week is that HE IS WRONG, you do the best you can, and the Holy Ghost will teach the rest. You're just there to spread the word, the Spirit is who really teaches and truly invites them to the Gospel. I have truly learned so much, and hope you all are safe!

> But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on His holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love, and all longsuffering.
